Create a database called 'my_first_db'.
use my_first_db


Create students collection.
db.createCollection('students')


Each document you insert into this collection should have the following format: ({name: STRING, home_state: STRING, lucky_number: NUMBER, birthday: {month: NUMBER, day: NUMBER, year: NUMBER}})


Create 5 students with the appropriate info.
db.students.insert({name: "Christian", home_state: "California", lucky_number: 10, birthday: {month: 4, day: 10, year: 1992}})
db.students.insert({name: "Justin", home_state: "California", lucky_number: 24, birthday: {month: 3, day: 20, year: 1994}})
db.students.insert({name: "James", home_state: "California", lucky_number: 8,
birthday: {month: 4, day: 20, year: 1993}})
db.students.insert({name: "Brayan", home_state: "California", lucky_number: 69
, birthday:{month: 6, day: 9, year: 1969}})
db.students.insert({name: "Dip", home_state: "Washington", lucky_number: 3, bi
rthday:{month: 3, day: 6, year: 1999}})


Get all students.
db.students.find()


Retrieve all students who are from California (San Jose Dojo) or Washington (Seattle Dojo).
db.students.find({home_state: "California"})


Get all students whose lucky number is greater than 3
db.students.find({lucky_number: {$gt: 3}})


Get all students whose lucky number is less than or equal to 10
db.students.find({lucky_number: {$lte: 10}})


Get all students whose lucky number is between 1 and 9 (inclusive)
db.students.find({$and: [{lucky_number: {$gte:1}}, {lucky_number: {$lte: 9}}]})


Add a field to each student collection called 'interests' that is an ARRAY. It should contain the following entries: 'coding', 'brunch', 'MongoDB'. Do this in ONE operation.
db.students.updateMany({}, {$set: {'interests': ['coding', 'brunch', 'MongoDB']}})


Add some unique interests for each particular student into each of their interest arrays.
db.students.update({name: "Christian"}, {$push: {'interest': "cooking"}})
db.students.update({name: "Justin"}, {$push: {'interest': "heelys"}})
db.students.update({name: "Brayan"}, {$push: {'interest': "anime"}})
db.students.update({name: "James"}, {$push: {'interest': "drinking"}})
db.students.update({name: "Dip"}, {$push: {'interest': "playing"}})


Add the interest 'taxes' into someone's interest array.
db.students.update({name: "Christian"}, {$push: {'interest': "taxes"}})


Remove the 'taxes' interest you just added.
db.students.updateMany({},{$pull: {'interest': "taxes"}})


Remove all students who are from California.
db.students.remove({home_state: "California"})


Remove a student by name.
db.students.remove({name: "Christian"})


Remove a student whose lucky number is greater than 5 (JUST ONE)
db.students.deleteOne({lucky_number: {$gt: 5}})


Add a field to each student collection called 'number_of_belts' and set it to 0.
db.students.updateMany({}, {$set: {'number_of_belts': 0}})


Increment this field by 1 for all students in Washington (Seattle Dojo).
db.students.updateMany({home_state: "Washington"}, {$set: {'number_of_belts': 1}})


Rename the 'number_of_belts' field to 'belts_earned'
db.students.updateMany({}, {$rename: {"number_of_belts": "belts_earned"}})


Remove the 'lucky_number' field.
db.students.updateMany({}, {$unset: {lucky_number: ""}})


Add a 'updated_on' field, and set the value as the current date.
db.students.updateMany({}, {$currentDate: {updated_on: {$type: "date"}}})
